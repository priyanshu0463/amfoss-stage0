# geo_quest

This Flutter application is designed to help users find a route between their current location and a marked point on a map. The app leverages the power of OpenStreetMap (OSM) to provide an interactive and customizable mapping experience. Whether you're building a navigation app, a travel planner, or simply want to assist users in getting from point A to point B, this project serves as a great starting point.
