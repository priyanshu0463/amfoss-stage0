# Errors

I got an issue when attempting to retrieve a Pokémon image. Despite trying various approaches to resolve the problem, you were unable to retrieve the image successfully. As a workaround, you decided to include a default image in case the requested image failed to load. This allows your application to display an image consistently, even when there are problems fetching the Pokémon image.
