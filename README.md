# Introduction
Hello, I am Priyanshu, currently pursuing Electrical and Computer Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri.  When I was still mulling over my options for college, I was prioritizing the ones with clubs centered on coding. I came across amFOSS and their list of accomplishments made a lasting impression on me. This is when I felt motivated to become a part of it.
In my previous attempt to join the club, I was able complete most of the tasks and received the chace to be interviewed. However, due to my own shortcomings and lack of depth in knowledge surrounding the tasks, I was rejected. I had no intention of giving up, as I used this setback as an opportunity to sharpen my skills and took on beginner-friendly projects in web development.
I am devoted to seamlessly blending my academic pursuits with my passion for technology, with the end goal of acquiring the necessary skills to actively to contribute to organizations that can bring a real positive change in the future.

# My views about the tasks

The set of tasks provided were very thought provoking as there was no straightforward way to solve them, forcing me to approach them in a perspective that I would never have thought of otherwise. The problems themselves were on a spectrum of increasing difficulty. While working on these tasks, I slowly became aware of the trials and tribulations that awaited me if I wanted to be on par with the other members. The experience was indeed very rewarding and it helped me push through to continue to learn and improve myself in order to contribute effectively to the collective.
