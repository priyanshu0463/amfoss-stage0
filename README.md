# Introduction
Hello, I'm Priyanshu, and I'm currently pursuing a 4-year B.Tech course in ELC at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. During my search for colleges, I came across amFOSS, and the club's impressive track record made a lasting impression on me, motivating me to become a part of it.

In my previous attempt to join the club, I completed most of the main tasks and even earned a spot for an interview. However, due to my inefficiency and lack of a deep understanding of the tasks, I faced rejection. Nevertheless, I used that setback as an opportunity to sharpen my skills and took on beginner-friendly projects in web development.

I'm devoted to seamlessly blending my academic pursuits with my passion for technology, with the goal of acquiring the necessary skills to contribute meaningfully to forward-thinking organizations.
